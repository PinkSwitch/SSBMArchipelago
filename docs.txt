Ideas; Items that you unlock include modes;
Option for 1-player C-stick smashes. Just gotta NOP out 8016B480

Option for Character Trophies, one per mode? 

Goal settings; Trophy Hunt, collect X trophies
Events; beat Event 51
Option for Eventsanity?
20-coin packs are definitely going in the item pool
Option for Bonus-sanity
Progressive events unlock?
Option to turn off bonuses that would be hard for one person
Option to just disable some specific checks, maybe
Progressive Mode Difficulty
Option for itemsanity later (adds items as items you can get, not checks)
I want to add an option to lock ALL characters (or unlock all by default)
I already know how to do this. I can just make my own bitfield that returns 1A if they aren't unlocked
Also eventually maybe Movesanity
Stock Capacity
Option to randomize event matches
Random thought- Can I modify text to show item names? I might be able to do the Messages. Maybe trophy names from like the lottery
We'll say that 11-combo in training requires just Yoshi to do the combo?
Progressive Event Pack
Option to start with 1 random 1Player mode- Either a Main one or Side one
Increase the Coin rate
Unlock for melee types like Coin battle?
Should I have Progressive Trophy Pool or keep the original reqs?
IDEA I WANT TO DO!!! I can make the Vs match count just go up by 5 instead of reducing the count.
Then I have an option for "Max VS Mode checks"
If I can track the Stage ID, maybe I can add Past and other stages to All-Star or Classic
Should I add one MORE event pack for allowing selection of the mode at all?

----
vs checks
$80172640 is the 4995 check
------------
Trophies from the server should increment the trophy Counter and give 1 of the trophy.

$803173C8 checks the Percent? Also 803173D8
------------
First, check if continues > 0
if not...
Is the character Marth?
	If yes, unlock Roy
Is he character Mario?
	If yes, unlock Dr. Mario
---------------------------
TODO;
I think All-Star stops pawning trophies if you have all of them. I should investgate and swap to the Checked flag
I should change the 1P ending to how characters cleared instead of trophies owned
Difficulty option or HRC
Remove the guaranteed trophies from being guaranteed
Add Item Locking
Change all event goal to 1-49
Goal for event 50
Allow /rig to not have spaces or whatever
Option for expected HRC difficulty?
Master/good/casual/baby
Very Hard goal
Double check my code used for uh.... lotter percent checker
(Make sure this isn't weird with trophies appending to the pool)
Are starting inv trophies acting weird
Is Rocket KO 1P only?
Version checking

URGENT STUFF; Is it creating extra shit? Someone had 1 required trophy, and 1 in start inventory. It should have not generated any, but apparently it generated the one in start inventory?

Check on how I did the Guaranteed trophies. Is it still creating them...?
Option to reduce coin counts for continuing. Halve, quarter, default, or free
Implement a version checker. I can have the client check the version, and store the generated version on the server via slot data

For some reason my Char Select Icons table adjustments causes the secret icons to break? I wonder if something is intertwined somehow. Maybe I should go back to trying to figure out the question marks...
Lottery can sometimes say 0%
I think my Percent Checker code might not be working? like how did I get these numbers
Master Hand goal
Remove the Stage trophies from always being in the pool; remove/add their checks accordingly
It's possible to get into training with no cpu somehow (Only with my hide char func)

KNOWN ISSUES:
The lottery sometimes says you have a 0% of new trophy. I tried. I don't know how to fix the percentage it shows you. Actually ROLLING trophies should consider checked trophies as unique properly

-------------------------------
FOR POKEMON DOCUMENTATION
$8027A540 CHECKS THE ENCOUNTER RATE; 1/251 FOR MEW
$8027A560 checks if Mew has been spawned already in the battle
$8027A570 checks if Mew *can* spawn.
I think one of these is an RNG call...
Random port colors somehow? probably not gonna happen
IMPORTANT!!! MY RECEIVED INDEX IS AT $8045C368!!!
$80479D30 is the Menu Mode. 0x0D is for Trophy Collection- check trophy goal here
--------
FUTURE STUFF
Option to change default ruleset to Stock?
Option to make Home-Run Easier by giving 15 or 20 seconds?
Instead of having birdo and the stages trophies always in; Subject them to the Random pool. If they're in, add their check
Meters and KOs filler
Game-specific logger?
Maybe the Goal should be a list instead of a bunch of toggles
IMPORTANT! MOVE ALL MY VARS THAT THE SERVER USES INTO GECKO ENGINE SO THEY DONT CHANGE WHEN I ADD CODE
Make all-star not unlock itself
Move Shuffle
Item Shuffle
Maybe instead of a global check for the trophy in the client, I can make messages show up in the menu when you get the trophy
Maybe I can hook into the Tom Nook func for this?
Progressive Mode Difficulty?
Max 1-P Stock?
Option for 10-man smash clears?
All secret chars and all secret stages checks? On the messages
Should i add a check for the Heart Container trophy? Maybe I should make all the VS trophies super low (Food, Smash Coin, Maxim, Heart Container) and put them in the Base pool. Now there's a thought. And the option can specifically be LONG vs checks
Is it possible AT ALL to replace the characters with question mark icons
------------------
NOTES ON TROPHY CLASS
The 250 trophy check, i noticed, checks if the trophy class is already set first. If it's not, then we check the count.
$80305918- Sets Class R3.
R4 and R5 might need to be 0 for this
0- 1P Only
1- Special trophies
3- Base Pool
4- Adventure/Classic
5- 200 VS matches
6- All Characters
7- 250 Trophies
8- Super Special (can't unlock this way)
$803058B0 is where this is coming from
$80312494/$800031F4- Set All Chars class
0x04: Base class
0x10: Adventure/Classic
0x20: 200 vs
0x40: All Characters
0x80: 250 Trophies
I think the Pool gets saved into your file?
What do I Need
I'm not fully sure why, but for the Class to update, $804A284C needs to be written to. 
That's (r30 = 804a26b8 + 0x194). 250 trophies sets it to 2
------------
Trophy doc stuff
is $80312380 the Sound checker?
$80316450/54 checks if a trophy is owned to display the New text or not
$803048C0 returns the amount of trophy R3

The debug menu has an ITEM spawner mid match. This might help me find an item spawn function.

Somehow 80264834 is helping me find out how to disable pictures. if I NOP it, Zelda and Pikachu disappear, but only them...
If I load 0 at $80264804 Zelda gets blanked?

OKAY! The pictures thing happens in 2 parts.
1. $80264804 runs a routine that checks if the character is technically unlocked or not. It returns 1 if it is and 0 if not.

2. $803f10d4 contains a table of Unlock handlers. 
$80264868- Lockable
$802648D0- Always unlocked. I need to change these to be Lockable and modify the above routine
OKAY! So it turns out that this is not quite it. This table defines whether or not a portait is Invisible when locked. 68- Invisible, D0- Visible. The ?? check happens later...
This table is read at $8026485C btw
$802648F8 calls a routine. If I skip it, all chars unlock. So this is a lock check?

$80260CB4 calls a routine that flashes the icon
$80260D08 loads 12 and stores it somewhere? if I nope it out they disappear afterwards
This seems to be the time it lasts?
$803F0D57 is a timer for clicking on char. When it hits 0, it resets their picture, even if it was previously a ?

Found some interesting code. When the thing needs to flash, it loads 1 into r7 and calls $80364C08
I finally got something. $810F3AA1 is 80 for ? and 0 for icon. This is jigglypuff, the character icon. The backround is 0x70 bytes down, another 80

NEW LINE OF THINKING- 802648DC loads into R3 an address/offset for the char.
A0 per char. 810e11e0 for mew2

Interesting. $8803F12D4 seems to be an Item struct of some kind
Specifically, $803F1414 is a table containing pointers to something. If I zero it out, that item can't spawn. I can USE this!!!
This is just a visual effect. But maybe I can trace this?

FOR ITEM SHUFFLE::::::::
My code can inject at $80189544. R4 is the ID of the item spawned.
Turns out this is only for training mode...
This needs more work.
The visual table is a good start. the code that reads from it is $8026862c
//////////
MOVE SHUFFFLE!
Jigglypuff Target Test needs either Side Special or Any Aerial besides down
Luigi- ANY Aerial OR ANy Special
Pikachu- Neutral or up special
Ice Climbers- ANY Aerial or Any Special besides Up

Is $80226324 spawn item? $8022631C stores it when using Debug item spawn...
$80226478 Calls a spawn item, from Debug Spawn
$80268B18- Spawn Item
$8005FDDC- Spawner Visual
For item spawning;
Fix training mode
Check items spawning from containers
Home-run contest
8026c8d4

Important- 0x80453130; Pointer to char ata
80284860- Spawner for the HRC bat
