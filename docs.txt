Ideas; Items that you unlock include modes;
Option for 1-player C-stick smashes. Just gotta NOP out 8016B480

Option for Character Trophies, one per mode? 

Goal settings; Trophy Hunt, collect X trophies
Events; beat Event 51
Option for Eventsanity?
20-coin packs are definitely going in the item pool
Option for Bonus-sanity
Progressive events unlock?
Option to turn off bonuses that would be hard for one person
Option to just disable some specific checks, maybe
Progressive Mode Difficulty
Option for itemsanity later (adds items as items you can get, not checks)
I want to add an option to lock ALL characters (or unlock all by default)
I already know how to do this. I can just make my own bitfield that returns 1A if they aren't unlocked
Also eventually maybe Movesanity
Stock Capacity
Option to randomize event matches
Random thought- Can I modify text to show item names? I might be able to do the Messages. Maybe trophy names from like the lottery
We'll say that 11-combo in training requires just Yoshi to do the combo?
Progressive Event Pack
Option to start with 1 random 1Player mode- Either a Main one or Side one
Increase the Coin rate
Unlock for melee types like Coin battle?
Should I have Progressive Trophy Pool or keep the original reqs?
IDEA I WANT TO DO!!! I can make the Vs match count just go up by 5 instead of reducing the count.
Then I have an option for "Max VS Mode checks"
If I can track the Stage ID, maybe I can add Past and other stages to All-Star or Classic
Should I add one MORE event pack for allowing selection of the mode at all?

$80316438 is the Give trophy function. From the lottery? R3 contains the trophy id

----
vs checks
$80172640 is the 4995 check
------------
Trophies from the server should increment the trophy Counter and give 1 of the trophy.

$803173C8 checks the Percent? Also 803173D8
------------
First, check if continues > 0
if not...
Is the character Marth?
	If yes, unlock Roy
Is he character Mario?
	If yes, unlock Dr. Mario
---------------------------
TODO;
Lottery can sometimes say 0%
Option for starting character
Reduce the 10,000 meters requirement


KNOWN ISSUES:
The lottery sometimes says you have a 0% of new trophy. I tried. I don't know how to fix the percentage it shows you. Actually ROLLING trophies should consider checked trophies as unique properly

-------------------------------
FOR POKEMON DOCUMENTATION
$8027A540 CHECKS THE ENCOUNTER RATE; 1/251 FOR MEW
$8027A560 checks if Mew has been spawned already in the battle
$8027A570 checks if Mew *can* spawn.
I think one of these is an RNG call...
Random port colors somehow? probably not gonna happen
IMPORTANT!!! MY RECEIVED INDEX IS AT $8045C368!!!
$80479D30 is the Menu Mode. 0x0D is for Trophy Collection- check trophy goal here
--------
FUTURE STUFF
Instead of having birdo and the stages trophies always in; Subject them to the Random pool. If they're in, add their check
Meters and KOs filler
Game-specific logger?
Maybe the Goal should be a list instead of a bunch of toggles
IMPORTANT! MOVE ALL MY VARS THAT THE SERVER USES INTO GECKO ENGINE SO THEY DONT CHANGE WHEN I ADD CODE
Make all-star not unlock itself
Move Shuffle
Item Shuffle
Maybe instead of a global check for the trophy in the client, I can make messages show up in the menu when you get the trophy
Maybe I can hook into the Tom Nook func for this?
Progressive Mode Difficulty?
Max 1-P Stock?
Option for 10-man smash clears?
All secret chars and all secret stages checks? On the messages
Should i add a check for the Heart Container trophy? Maybe I should make all the VS trophies super low (Food, Smash Coin, Maxim, Heart Container) and put them in the Base pool. Now there's a thought. And the option can specifically be LONG vs checks
Is it possible AT ALL to replace the characters with question mark icons
------------------
NOTES ON TROPHY CLASS
The 250 trophy check, i noticed, checks if the trophy class is already set first. If it's not, then we check the count.
$80305918- Sets Class R3.
R4 and R5 might need to be 0 for this
0- 1P Only
1- Special trophies
3- Base Pool
4- Adventure/Classic
5- 200 VS matches
6- All Characters
7- 250 Trophies
8- Super Special (can't unlock this way)
$803058B0 is where this is coming from
$80312494/$800031F4- Set All Chars class
0x04: Base class
0x10: Adventure/Classic
0x20: 200 vs
0x40: All Characters
0x80: 250 Trophies
I think the Pool gets saved into your file?
What do I Need
I'm not fully sure why, but for the Class to update, $804A284C needs to be written to. 
That's (r30 = 804a26b8 + 0x194). 250 trophies sets it to 2
------------
Trophy doc stuff
is $80312380 the Sound checker?
$80316450/54 checks if a trophy is owned to display the New text or not
$803048C0 returns the amount of trophy R3

The debug menu has an ITEM spawner mid match. This might help me find an item spawn function.
